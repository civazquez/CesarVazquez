    <h2><a href="datavisualizations/dataviz1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual: The number of people infected vid covid-19 as well as the number of deaths in Canada.</a></h2>
    <h3>In this visualization we get some data from All of Us to plot the number of people in Canada infected with covid-19 and see how it relates to the deaths related to covid-19.</h3>
    <p><strong>Tasks:</strong><ol>
        <li>Load in the data.</li>
        <li>Clean the data.</li>
        <li>Select only Canada.</li>
        <li>Create the line graph of the total number of infected and total number of deaths in Canada.</li>
      </ol></p>

    <h2><a href="datavisualizations/dataviz2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual: Graph and compare covid-19 related deaths between Spain, Italy, France, and Germany.</a></h2>
    <h3>In this visualization we will graph 4 European countries to compare how many new deaths they have gotten every day throughout the pandemic.</h3>
    <p><strong>Tasks:</strong><ol>
        <li>Import the necessary libraries as well as reading the file in.</li>
        <li>We now filter the data to include only the rows for Spain, Italy, France, and Germany.</li>
        <li>Calculate the median age for each country. For each country we will assign a darker colored blue for higher median age and a lighter blue for the lower median age.</li>
        <li>A line graph is made of the daily new deaths, set the y-axis limit so we see the values more clearly, and set the titles for the axes.</li>
      </ol></p>

    <h2><a href="datavisualizations/dataviz3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual: Compare the number of new cases in five different European Countries.</a></h2>
    <h3>In this visualization we graph the number of new cases 5 different European countries report during the pandemic.</h3>
    <p><strong>Tasks:</strong><ol>
        <li>Import the necessary libraries as well as reading the file in.</li>
        <li>Filter the data to include only the European countries, namely Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Poland.</li>
        <li>Use a scatterplot to graph the data obtained from All of Us.</li>
        <li>Apply some smoothing so the data is easier interpreted.</li>
      </ol></p>

    <h2><a href="datavisualizations/datavizfinal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual: Analyze relations between variables from the University of Texas at El Paso.</a></h2>
    <h3>We investigate any relationships between variables such as Funding, Classification, Ethnicity, and Gender using visualizations.</h3>
    <p><strong>Tasks:</strong><ol>
        <li>Install pywaffle to be able to make waffle graphs.</li>
        <li>Import the necessary libraries as well as reading the file in.</li>
        <li>Graph food security based on the the different types of government funding using a waffle charts where each square represents 1%.</li>
        <li>Provide another view of the charts, so the proportions are seen better.</li>
        <li>Output the number of entries in each of Classification, College Choice, and Food Security.</li>
        <li>Compare College Choice with Food Security using a Stacked Bar Plot.</li>
        <li>Compare Classification with Food Security using a Stacked Bar Plot.</li>
        <li>Next, we output the number of entries in each of Classification, College Choice, Ethnicity and Gender.</li>
        <li>Compare differences of concentration in gender when it comes to degree progress (classification).</li>
        <li>Graph histograms of different ethnicities and their completion of degrees.</li>
      </ol></p>
