    <h2><a href="mlprojects/Project2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project: Classifying handwritten digits dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository</a></h2>
    <h3>In this project I perform some basic data compilation and manipulation,
        exploratory data analysis, PCA, multidimensional scaling (MDS), and tSNE.</h3>
    <p><strong>Tasks:</strong><ol>
        <li>Read both the training and the test data set into R.</li>
        <li>Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using a heatmap.</li>
        <li>Run PCA with with and obtain the scree plot.</li>
        <li>Try out classical MDS with a Manhattan-based distance matrix.</li>
        <li>Apply tSNE to the data.</li>
      </ol></p>

    <h3>In this project I perfrom Agglomerative Clustering, K-means clustering, and Hierarchical Clustering.</h3>
    <p><strong>Tasks:</strong><ol>
        <li>Read the data into R. List the missing rate (in percentage) for each variable.</li>
        <li>Do some data cleaning by replacing missing values for both JOB and REASON with default constant “Unknown”.</li>
        <li>Perform the (natural) logarithm transformation.</li>
        <li>Impute all the remaining values.</li>
        <li>Obtain a distance matrix.</li>
        <li>Cluster the data by excluding the variable BAD.</li>
        <li>Make a two-way contingency table that compares two clustering results.</li>
        <li>conduct some post hoc analysis using various numerical and graphical tools.</li>

    <h3>In this project I investigate if there are certain variables that determine whether someone will default on a loan. I perfrom Agglomerative Clustering, K-means clustering, and Hierarchical Clustering.</h3>
    <p><strong>Tasks:</strong><ol>
        <li>EDA by obtaining the histograms of both salary and the logarithm (natural base) of salary.</li>
        <li>Inspect for any missing data.</li>
        <li>Partition the data and apply variable selection methods.</li>
        <li>Output the necessary fitting results for each best model and apply it to the test data.</li>
        <li>Refit the final model using the entire data.</li>
        <li>Check normality, homoscedasticity, independence, linearity as well as detecting outliers and assessing multicollinearity.</li>
        <li>Apply the final model to predict the log-salary for the new data set.</li>
      </ol></p>

    <h3>In this In this project, we analyze communities and crime data using 5 different regression models.</h3>
    <p><strong>Tasks:</strong><ol>
        <li>Prepare data by removing, imputing, or replacing appropriately.</li>
        <li>Conduct some EDA, mostly by checking the distribution of the target variable.</li>
        <li>Partition the data.</li>
        <li>Do predictive modeling with LASSO Regression.</li>
        <li>Do predictive modeling with Principal Components Regression.</li>
        <li>Try Partial Least Squares Regression.</li>
        <li>Finally, try Weighted Orthogonal Components Regression as well as Stagewise Regression.</li>
        <li>Test and compare the models.</li>

    <h2><a href="mlprojects/Project6.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project: Seeing what factors affect liver disease.</a></h2>
    <h3>In this project I we consider the Indian Liver Patient dataset, use regression models, and compare the models using an ROC curve.</h3>
    <p><strong>Tasks:</strong><ol>
        <li>Prepare and clean the data via listwise deletion or imputation.</li>
        <li>For each categorical predictor I use chi squared-test of independence to assess its association with the binary response liver.</li>
        <li>For other types of predictors I use either two-sample t test.</li>
        <li>Applying a threshold significance level alpha = 0.20, I exclude predictors that are associated with a p-value larger than that from the subsequent logistic model fitting.</li>
        <li>Fit the full model with all predictors that have passed the screening.</li>
        <li>Select the best model stepwise selection at the aid of BIC.</li>
        <li>select the best model with one of the regularization methods with different types of penalties.</li>
        <li> Compute the jackknife predicted probabilities from every model.</li>
        <li>Plot their ROC curves and find their AUC values.</li>
        <li>Interpret the results within the liver disease diagnostic context.</li>
